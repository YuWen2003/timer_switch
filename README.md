# timer_switch
Design a program that can contain two timers that can be switched freely, and meet the following requirements: 
(1) The timer should print 2 digits after the decimal point.
(2) While one timer is running, the other timer should be stopped.
(3) Switch the timer when any button is pressed.
(4) When switching back, the timer will continue to run from the time it has already run.
(5) The time of the timer is updated every 100ms, and the screen is cleared every time it is printed out.
